# About
Subscript is an html5 (and aspiring desktop) UI framework that facilitates rapid development VIA a batteries included toolkit, and selector-less CSS styling.

Notable features:
  * Automatic saving and reloading of app state, i.e. the model. (where rust’s traits really shine)
  * components + heterogeneous broadcast/messaging system

Less notable features:
  * <b>Selector-less</b> CSS rules, media-queries and pseudo-elements. 
    * And therein using the rust module system for namespacing (i.e. no need for css modules).
  * <b>One-liner friendly</b> (i.e. not XML syntax) DSL.
  * <b>Unified medium</b> for defining html markup, css styling and event handlers.

## Target

The Subscript infrastructure is designed with an eye towards maximum SASS frontend development productivity, where code-size is a relatively low priority and performance is supposed to be at least “good enough”.

The target demographic is primarily backend developers like myself working on projects that require a frontend to their service thats easy to maintain while building out backend services.

## Status:
<b>Not yet ready for general release or public consumption.</b>
