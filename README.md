# Subscript - Typesetting & Publishing using Web Technologies

> Note, originally Subscript referred to a frontend UI framework, but that has been abandoned, Iâ€™m recycling the old Subscript name for a new project. The old project can be found here [colbyn/subscript-old](https://github.com/colbyn/subscript-old).


## High Level TODO:

- [CSS Paged Media](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-page-3/): support traditional print use cases, or just rendering to a PDF. This is what I am currently planning on using for rendering to e.g. PDFs: [PagedJS](https://www.pagedjs.org)
